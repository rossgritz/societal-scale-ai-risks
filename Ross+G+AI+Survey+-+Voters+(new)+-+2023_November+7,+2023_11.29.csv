For example, advanced AI might make surveillance more common and more acceptable for preventing crime, or, it might increase the demand for value of training data for AI models tremendously, resulting in a loosening of privacy protections.",How impactful do you think risks to privacy protections from advanced AI might be for society?,"What is the likelihood that in the next decade or two advanced AI results in extreme income inequality? For example, this might happen if advanced AI driven productivity gains generate tremendous new wealth, overwhelmingly benefiting those who are already very wealthy, while those with few or no investments see little or no benefits.",How impactful do you think severe income inequality from advanced AI might be for society?,What is the likelihood that in the next decade or two terrorists use advanced AI to create a deadly biological weapon or chemical weapon that is used at least once against a large number of civilians in a major terrorist attack?,How impactful do you think terrorist attacks with deadly biological or chemical weapons developed with advanced AI might be for society?,"What is the likelihood that in the next decade or two terrorists use advanced AI to create autonomous AI weapons for use in attacking civilians?
